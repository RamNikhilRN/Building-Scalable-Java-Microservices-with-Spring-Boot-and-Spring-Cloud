"Â¨Microservices"" describes a software design pattern in which an application is a collection of loosely coupled services. These services are fine-grained, and can be individually maintained and scaled. The microservices architecture is ideal for the public cloud, with its focus on elastic scaling with on-demand resources. In this course, I have learnt how to build Java applications using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud on Google Cloud. 

What i learnt:
Build Spring Boot microservices that consume Google Cloud managed services

Send and receive messages with Pub/Sub and Spring Integration.

Use Cloud SQL as a managed relational database for your Java applications, and migrate to Cloud Spanner

Implement distributed tracing by using Cloud Trace
